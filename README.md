# EconomistGraphicRedone
I took the invitation to recreate an data graphic from [an article redesigning past Economist graphs](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368). This data graphic goes with a March 2017 article titled ["Science remains male-dominated"](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2017/03/11/science-remains-male-dominated).
